# vpn-deployment-acl-lab
This lab simulates the deployment of secure site-to-site VPN tunnels between virtual sites. Access Control Lists (ACLs) are applied to restrict traffic, ensuring secure and filtered communication between networks. The lab demonstrates VPN setup, IPsec tunnel configuration, ACL application, and basic packet capture verification.
